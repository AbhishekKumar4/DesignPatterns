# Design Patterns
Design patterns refer to language independent solutions provided for solving commonly recurring design problems. A design pattern first describes problem and then the solution that can be applied to the problem.

There are various problems concerning the design issues of web application that may arise while developing the application. Some of the problems occur more often and creating a solution from scratch all over again every time the problem occurs results in wastage of time and efforts involved in the process of development of the web or enterprise application.

Therefore design patterns have been developed that provide proven solution to recurring problems while designing applications. The design pattern can be divided in to various categories on the basis of their application domains.

# Key points
1)	Design patterns provide tested solutions to frequently and repeated occurring problems.
2)	Provides code reusability.
3)	Helps in defining application architecture more efficiently and clearly.
4)	Provide more reliability and transparency to the design of the applications.

# Categories of Design patterns
1) Creational Patterns : Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

2) Structural Patterns : Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

3) Behavioral Pattern : Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

In next updates, I will be covering more about different patterns in above categories with examples.
